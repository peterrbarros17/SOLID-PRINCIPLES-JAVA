# SOLID Principles & Design Patterns - Study Repository

This repository contains examples and studies on SOLID principles and common design patterns using Java. The goal is to understand and apply clean code practices and improve software design skills.

## Progress

### Completed Principles:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - A class should have only one reason to change.
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** - Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** - Specific interfaces are the best of general interfaces.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** - High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
